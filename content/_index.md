I'm Raj Nandan Sharma—a full-stack engineer and engineering director based in Bengaluru, India. I build products end-to-end and enjoy taking ideas from the sketchpad to production. I've been writing code since 2012, mostly in **Go**, **Svelte**, and **NodeJS**.

My work sits at the intersection of fintech, AI, and developer tooling. At [Cashfree Payments](https://cashfree.com), I lead teams shipping high-scale payment systems. I've built search pipelines, crafted authentication flows, and designed internal platforms that keep businesses running. I like solving blunt, real problems—downtimes, latency, alerts, data modeling, shipping stable builds without drama.

On the side, I experiment with solo projects: agent-driven back-office tools, vector-based search for large text sources, regulatory-monitoring automation, browser-based terminals, bookmark managers, and status-page integrations. I keep a steady bias toward practical engineering—fewer moving parts, predictable behavior, clean interfaces.

I'm currently exploring solopreneurship and ways to turn engineering projects into usable products. If a system needs to be scraped, monitored, indexed, embedded, automated, or debugged at 2am, I'm usually interested.

I also game from time to time. My online alias is **purplewow**—mostly single-player, mostly souls-likes.

Technology should make life quieter, not louder. My work reflects that.
