Enterprise AI has grown from $1.7 billion in 2023 to $37 billion in 2025. That's not a typo. In just three years, AI has captured over 6% of the global SaaS market and become the fastest-scaling software category in history.

The bubble fears haven't materialized. The demand side tells a different story: broad adoption, real revenue, and productivity gains at scale.

## Where the Money Goes

The $37 billion breaks down into two main buckets:

**Applications ($19 billion):** The user-facing products that leverage AI models
- Departmental AI: $7.3B (coding, IT, marketing, customer success)
- Horizontal AI: $8.4B (copilots, agents, productivity tools)
- Vertical AI: $3.5B (healthcare, legal, finance)

**Infrastructure ($18 billion):** The picks and shovels
- Foundation model APIs: $12.5B
- Model training infrastructure: $4B
- AI infrastructure (storage, retrieval, orchestration): $1.5B

The shift is notable: more than half of enterprise AI spend now goes to applications rather than infrastructure. Enterprises are prioritizing immediate productivity gains over long-term infrastructure bets.

## The Buy vs. Build Flip

In 2024, enterprises were split—47% built internally, 53% purchased. A year later, it's not even close: **76% of AI use cases are now purchased rather than built internally**.

The conventional wisdom that enterprises would build most AI solutions themselves didn't hold. Ready-made AI solutions are reaching production faster and demonstrating immediate value while internal builds mature.

## AI Buyers Are Different

Enterprise AI buyers behave differently than traditional software buyers:

- **47% conversion rate** for AI deals (vs. 25% for traditional SaaS)
- **27% of AI spend** comes through product-led growth (vs. 7% for traditional software)
- Organizations surface 10+ potential use cases but focus on near-term productivity gains

That 47% conversion rate is remarkable. Once an organization commits to exploring an AI solution, deals close at nearly twice the rate of traditional software. The value is immediate and clear.

## PLG Is Eating Enterprise AI

Product-led growth is transforming enterprise AI adoption. Individual users now drive AI adoption at 4x the rate of traditional software.

The examples are striking:
- **Cursor** reached $200 million in revenue before hiring a single enterprise sales rep
- **n8n** formalized contracts only after hundreds of employees were already active users
- **ElevenLabs**, **Gamma**, and others scaled the same way

When you account for "shadow AI adoption"—employees using personal credit cards for tools like ChatGPT Plus—PLG-driven tools may represent close to 40% of application AI spend.

The pattern: developers and technical teams discover tools for individual use, prove value in day-to-day work, and create bottom-up demand that converts to enterprise contracts.

## Startups Are Winning the Application Layer

At the AI application layer, startups now capture nearly **$2 in revenue for every $1 earned by incumbents**—63% of the market, up from 36% last year.

This shouldn't be happening. Incumbents have distribution, data moats, enterprise relationships, sales teams, and massive balance sheets. Yet AI-native startups are out-executing across the fastest-growing categories.

**Why startups win:**

| Department | Startup Share | Why |
|------------|---------------|-----|
| Product + Engineering | 71% | Cursor beat GitHub Copilot by shipping faster—repo-level context, multi-file editing, model-agnostic approach |
| Sales | 78% | Clay, Actively attack workflows Salesforce doesn't own—research, personalization, enrichment from unstructured signals |
| Finance + Operations | 91% | Incumbents can't move fast enough; startups like Rillet and Numeric build AI-first ERPs |

The story changes at the infrastructure layer, where incumbents hold 56% of the market. Databricks, Snowflake, MongoDB, and Datadog have seen meaningful re-acceleration as even AI-native builders choose existing platforms.

## Coding: The First Killer Use Case

Coding is the breakout category. At $4 billion, it represents 55% of all departmental AI spend—the largest category across the entire application layer.

The numbers:
- 50% of developers now use AI coding tools daily (65% in top-quartile orgs)
- Code completion alone is $2.3B
- Code agents and AI app builders exploded from near-zero
- Teams report 15%+ velocity gains

AI now touches the entire software development lifecycle: prototyping (Lovable), code refactoring (OpenHands), design-to-code (Weaver), QA (Meticulous), PRs (Graphite), SRE (Resolve), and deployment (Harness).

## Anthropic Is Winning

The foundation model landscape shifted decisively. Anthropic now earns an estimated **40% of enterprise LLM spend**, up from 24% last year and 12% in 2023. OpenAI fell to 27% from 50% in 2023.

The three leaders—Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google—account for 88% of enterprise LLM API usage.

Anthropic's dominance comes from coding. They command **54% of the coding market** (vs. 21% for OpenAI), driven by an 18-month run atop leaderboards starting with Claude Sonnet 3.5 in June 2024.

## Agents: Mostly Hype (For Now)

For all the talk of agents, real production architectures remain surprisingly simple:

- Only **16% of enterprise** and **27% of startup** deployments qualify as true agents
- Most are still fixed-sequence or routing-based workflows around a single model call
- Prompt design remains the dominant customization technique, followed by RAG
- Fine-tuning, tool calling, and RL are still niche

Copilots dominate horizontal AI with 86% share ($7.2B). Agent platforms capture only 10% ($750M).

Strip away the hype and most "AI agents" are basic if-then logic around a model call. The architecture works for today's use cases—but it reveals how early we are.

## Healthcare Leads Vertical AI

Vertical AI solutions hit $3.5 billion, nearly 3x the prior year. Healthcare alone captures 43%—approximately $1.5 billion.

The bulk concentrates in administrative and clinical-adjacent workflows:
- **Ambient scribes**: $600M (+2.4x YoY), minting two new unicorns (Abridge, Ambience)
- Clinicians spend one hour documenting for every five hours of care
- Scribes that reduce documentation time by 50%+ are transformational

Beyond healthcare: legal ($650M), creator tools ($360M), and government ($350M). Adoption is strongest in industries historically underserved by software—fields defined by manual, unstructured workflows that once depended on human services.

## What's Next

Five predictions for 2026:

1. **AI will exceed human performance in daily practical programming tasks.** The best models keep getting better in verifiable domains like math and code.

2. **Jevons' paradox continues.** Net spend rises despite falling inference costs, driven by orders-of-magnitude increases in inference volume.

3. **Explainability and governance go mainstream.** As agents gain autonomy, the ability to explain and govern their decisions becomes critical. Governments will ask for audit logs.

4. **Models move to the edge.** Low-latency requirements, privacy, and cost push compute on-device. Mobile manufacturers ship dedicated low-power GPU compute.

5. **Benchmarks saturate but fail to capture real-world efficacy.** For frontier use cases like coding, users are price-insensitive and will pay more for performance.

## The Takeaway

Enterprise AI is no longer speculative. It's a $37 billion market growing faster than any software category in history.

The dynamics are clear:
- Enterprises are buying, not building
- Startups are winning the application layer
- Coding is the first killer use case
- Anthropic leads the enterprise LLM market
- Agents are mostly hype—for now
- PLG is driving adoption at unprecedented rates

Three years in, the transformation is real. The value is clear. And the pace isn't slowing.
